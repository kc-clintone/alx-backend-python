# Async Generators and Comprehensions

This project demonstrates the use of Python's asynchronous programming features, focusing on async generators and comprehensions. It includes coroutines to generate random numbers asynchronously and measure the runtime of parallel asynchronous tasks.

## Coroutines

### async_generator

The `async_generator` coroutine generates random numbers asynchronously.

#### Implementation

```python
import asyncio
import random

async def async_generator():
    for _ in range(10):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        yield random.uniform(0, 10)
```

### async_comprehension

The `async_comprehension` coroutine collects 10 random numbers generated by `async_generator` using an asynchronous list comprehension.

#### Implementation

```python
from async_generator import async_generator

async def async_comprehension():
    return [number async for number in async_generator()]
```

### measure_runtime

The `measure_runtime` coroutine measures the runtime of executing `async_comprehension` four times in parallel using `asyncio.gather`.

#### Implementation

```python
import asyncio
import time
from async_comprehension import async_comprehension

async def measure_runtime():
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    await asyncio.gather(
        async_comprehension(),
        async_comprehension(),
        async_comprehension(),
        async_comprehension()
    )
    end_time = time.perf_counter()
    return end_time - start_time

async def main():
    runtime = await measure_runtime()
    print(f"Total runtime: {runtime} seconds")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the files.
3. Run `measure_runtime.py` to see the output.

```sh
python measure_runtime.py
```

## Explanation

### Why the Total Runtime is Roughly 10 Seconds

Each `async_comprehension` coroutine runs for approximately 10 seconds because it includes waiting for 1 second 10 times, one for each random number. Running four instances in parallel using `asyncio.gather` does not multiply the wait time by four because they execute concurrently. Therefore, the total runtime is the same as the longest single instance, which is about 10 seconds.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of Python's asynchronous programming capabilities. By using async generators and comprehensions, you can handle asynchronous operations efficiently and write clean, readable code.
