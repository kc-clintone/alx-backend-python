## Overview

This repository is structured into three main subfolders, each focusing on a specific topic within Python programming:

1. **Variable Annotations**: Learn how to use type hints and annotations to make your code more readable and maintainable.
2. **Asynchronous Functions**: Understand the basics of asynchronous programming using `asyncio`.
3. **Asynchronous Comprehensions**: Dive deeper into asynchronous programming with async generators and comprehensions.

## Folder Structure

### 0x00-python_variable_annotations

This folder introduces Python variable annotations, which help in specifying the type of variables for better code clarity and debugging.

- **0-add.py**: Function to add two floating-point numbers.
- **1-concat.py**: Function to concatenate two strings.
- **100-safe_first_element.py**: Function to safely get the first element of a sequence.
- **101-safely_get_value.py**: Function to safely retrieve a value from a dictionary.
- **102-type_checking.py**: Function demonstrating the use of `mypy` for type checking.
- **2-floor.py**: Function to return the floor of a floating-point number.
- **3-to_str.py**: Function to convert a float to a string.
- **4-define_variables.py**: Demonstrates how to define variables with type annotations.
- **5-sum_list.py**: Function to sum a list of floats.
- **6-sum_mixed_list.py**: Function to sum a mixed list of integers and floats.
- **7-to_kv.py**: Function to return a tuple.
- **8-make_multiplier.py**: Function to return a function that multiplies a float by a given multiplier.
- **9-element_length.py**: Function to return a list of tuples with the element and its length.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the variable annotations project.

### 0x01-python_async_function

This folder focuses on the basics of asynchronous programming using Python's `asyncio` module.

- **0-basic_async_syntax.py**: Basic async function demonstrating the use of `await`.
- **1-concurrent_coroutines.py**: Running multiple coroutines concurrently.
- **2-measure_runtime.py**: Measuring the runtime of concurrent coroutines.
- **3-tasks.py**: Creating and managing tasks with `asyncio`.
- **4-tasks.py**: Another example of managing tasks.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the async functions project.

### 0x02-python_async_comprehension

This folder covers asynchronous comprehensions and async generators.

- **0-async_generator.py**: An async generator that yields random numbers.
- **1-async_comprehension.py**: Async comprehension to collect random numbers.
- **2-measure_runtime.py**: Measure runtime for async comprehensions running in parallel.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the async comprehensions project.
